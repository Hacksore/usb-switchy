# usb-switchy

Attempting to make a super fast keyboard/mouse switcher with an excessive amount of Arduinos ðŸ˜Ž

### Why?

I want to build something that overcomes the delay that mondern KVMs have. They act is if the devices is unplugged and plugged into the next machine, which takes time for the OS to pickup movement/keystrokes.
